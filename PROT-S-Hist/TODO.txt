Set up a new data structure?

d = number of possible answers
m = number of users
e_vi = standard basis vector

1. R: we need to make a randomization scheme (DONE)
2. PROT-FO: create a frequency oracle pg 7
3. GenProj(m,d): This generates a mxd phi matrix pg 6
4. PROTPP-S-HIST-pp: Encapsulates all the other things and Afo to avg pg 9
5. Afo to calculate the frequency of the input value pg 7
